\section{Parallel stuff}

1a) nprocs() is one larger than nworkers(). So there seems to be one process
that manages all the ones that will do the actual computation.

1b) As you told us, the functions are only defined on the main process, not the
workers.

1c) Presumably every worker writes to their own copy of 'integral', and the
main thread doesn't do anything, so 'integral' in the main thread remains 0.0.

pmap(): Looks like the main process is using one thread (ca~95\%), the other
two share the other one, but they don't use as much (ca 40\% each).
